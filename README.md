## 🎮 Interactive Features

### 1. Cellular Dynamics Simulator
Watch cells in action with our React-based simulator:
- **LIVE cell visualization** - See individual cells move, divide, and die
- **Real-time responses** - Cells react to glucose, oxygen, pH, temperature
- **Drug treatment simulation** - Apply compounds and watch effects
- **Multiple cell lines** - HeLa, A549, MCF-7, HEK293
- **Professional analysis** - Growth curves, viability tracking

### 2. Germ Layer Cancer Analysis
Revolutionary approach to cancer research:
- **Ectoderm cancers** (GBM, Melanoma) - Neural-derived, BBB-protected
- **Mesoderm cancers** (Leukemias, Sarcomas) - Blood/connective tissue
- **Endoderm cancers** (Lung, Pancreatic) - Internal organ-derived
- **Treatment predictions** based on embryonic origins
- **Resistance patterns** specific to each layer

### 3. Complete Research Pipeline
Everything integrated and ready:
```python
from tncp_starter_kit import ResearchPlatform

# Initialize the platform
platform = ResearchPlatform()

# Run cellular dynamics simulation
cells = platform.simulate_cells(
    cell_line="HeLa",
    duration_hours=72,
    treatment="cisplatin",
    concentration_uM=10
)

# Analyze cancer by germ layer
cancer_analysis = platform.analyze_cancer(
    cancer_type="NSCLC",
    method="germ_layer"
)

# Process medical images
image_results = platform.analyze_image(
    "scan.dcm",
    segment_tumor=True,
    extract_features=True
)
```
